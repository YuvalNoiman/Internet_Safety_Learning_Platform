        <h3>Why it is important?</h3>
        <text>
            Most people who use the internet are not computer science majors with knowledge on what to do if something bad occurs. Due to these
            online resources not being helpful and used enough, many people, young and old, still fall victim to cyber attacks whether by social
            engineering scams or accidentally installing malware onto their devices. Dealing with getting scammed or getting rid of malware is costly
            and many people can lose their life savings in this process. Also, if their personal information is leaked it usually requires a lengthy process
            to recover/change it.
